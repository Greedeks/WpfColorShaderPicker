Ready-to-use custom controls ColorWheelPicker and HueColorPicker for WPF allow users to adjust colors and their brightness.
They are based on precompiled shaders HueBarEffect.hlsl and ColorWheelEffect.hlsl, providing flexibility and high performance in color processing.

The  `ColorWheelEffect.ps` and `HueBarEffect.ps` files must be set as Resource in the project properties during compilation.
