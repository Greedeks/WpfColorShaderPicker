Ready-to-use custom controls ColorWheelPicker and HueColorPicker for WPF allow users to adjust colors and their brightness.
They are based on precompiled shaders HueBarEffect.hlsl and ColorWheelEffect.hlsl, providing flexibility and high performance in color processing.


The `ColorWheelEffect.ps` and `HueBarEffect.ps` files must be placed in the project's Resource directory to correctly apply effects to UI elements. 
This ensures proper access to shaders within the application, enabling stable color processing and high-performance rendering, especially for dynamic color and brightness adjustments.
